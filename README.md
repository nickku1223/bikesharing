From this visualization we can see that totoal rides in August 2019 is 2.344,224. And the service subscriber weight more than 75% of the total customers.
As for peak hours, we can see that during 4pm to 7pm have the highest usage, but also note that 7am to 8am also has a small peak. We can suspect that those peak hours are people using the service to commute to work.
